    "The no-cloning theorem prohibits the existence of an algorithm that can make copies of arbitrary quantum states. However, it doesn't make any statements about the (non-)existence of algorithms that can produce something that looks *close* to the original state. In this set of exercises, you will learn how to implement a continuous-variable algorithm for approximately cloning *coherent states*."
